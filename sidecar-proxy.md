# Sidecar Proxy

A **sidecar proxy** is a software component that runs alongside an application, similar to how a sidecar is attached to a motorcycle. It acts as an intermediary, handling network traffic going to and from the application.

- **Position:** Runs in the same container or pod as the application it supports.
- **Function:** Acts as a middleman, intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic.
- **Benefits:** Provides various functionalities, including:
  - **Security:** Enforces security policies and authorization controls.
  - **Traffic management:** Routes requests, performs load balancing, and handles failures.
  - **Observability:** Collects metrics and logs for monitoring and debugging.

Sidecar proxies are commonly used in **service mesh** architectures, which manage communication between microservices in a distributed system. They offer a flexible and scalable approach to managing application functionality without directly modifying the application code itself.

While the concept of sidecar proxies isn't new, their popularity and widespread adoption have increased alongside the rise of **microservices** and **service mesh** architectures.

Here are some of the **most popular modern versions** of sidecar proxies used today:

- **Envoy:** An open-source, high-performance proxy widely used in various service meshes like Istio and Linkerd. It's known for its flexibility, scalability, and extensive feature set.
- **Linkerd2:** An open-source service mesh built on top of Envoy, known for its ease of use and focus on developer experience.
- **Ambassador:** An open-source service mesh built on top of Envoy, offering advanced features like rate limiting, web application firewalls, and API circuit breakers.
- **HAProxy:** A mature, open-source load balancing and proxy software that can be used as a sidecar proxy and is known for its stability and performance.

It's important to note that the "best" choice depends on your specific needs and requirements. Factors like feature set, complexity, ease of use, and community support should be considered when selecting a sidecar proxy for your project.
