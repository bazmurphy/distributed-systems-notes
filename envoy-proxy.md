# Envoy Proxy

Envoy is an **open-source, high-performance proxy** designed to simplify and manage communication between services in **microservices architectures**. It acts as a **sidecar proxy**, deployed alongside each service, and provides a layer of abstraction between services, enabling several key functionalities:

**1. Load Balancing:** Envoy efficiently distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service, ensuring high availability and scalability.

**2. Traffic Management:** It offers granular control over traffic flow through features like:

- **Rate limiting:** Prevents overloading services by limiting the number of requests they receive within a specific timeframe.
- **Circuit breaking:** Protects services from cascading failures by automatically stopping requests to a failing service and retrying later.
- **Fault injection:** Simulates failures to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses in the system.

**3. Security:** Envoy enhances security by:

- **Mutual TLS authentication:** Verifies the identity of both the client and server involved in communication.
- **Access control:** Restricts access to services based on predefined rules.
- **Encryption:** Protects data in transit between services.

**4. Observability:** Envoy provides deep insights into service communication by collecting and exporting detailed metrics and tracing data. This data is crucial for monitoring system health, identifying performance bottlenecks, and troubleshooting issues.

By employing Envoy Proxy, developers can:

- **Simplify service communication:** Manage complex interactions between services from a centralized location.
- **Ensure seamless communication:** Bridge the gap between services implemented in different languages and protocols.
- **Build scalable systems:** Handle growing traffic volumes efficiently.
- **Enhance security:** Implement robust security measures to protect services and data.

In essence, Envoy tackles the challenges of managing communication in modern, distributed applications, empowering developers to build **reliable, scalable, and secure microservices**.

While Envoy is an essential component of a service mesh, **it is not a service mesh itself**.

Here's the distinction:

- **Envoy** is the **data plane**: a distributed proxy responsible for managing communication between services. It provides the core functionalities mentioned previously like load balancing, traffic management, security, and observability.
- **Service mesh**: a **complete architecture** that manages communication between microservices. It consists of two main components:
  - **Data plane**: This is where Envoy comes in, handling the actual routing and manipulation of traffic on the sidecar proxies.
  - **Control plane**: This is the brain of the service mesh, responsible for configuration, policy enforcement, and service discovery. It manages the data plane and tells the proxies how to handle traffic.

Therefore, Envoy is a **building block** used to implement the data plane of a service mesh. Popular service mesh platforms like Istio and Linkerd utilize Envoy as their data plane, while offering additional features through the control plane, making them complete service mesh solutions.
